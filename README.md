                     MINI VOTING SYSTEM
ABSTRACT:-

An online voting system is a software platform that enables organizations to conduct votes and elections securely. A high-quality online voting system strikes a balance between ballot security, convenience, and the overall needs of a voting event. By collecting the input of your group in a systematic and verifiable manner, online voting tools and online election voting systems assist you in making crucial decisions. These decisions are frequently taken on a yearly basis – either during an event (such as your organization’s AGM) or at a specific time of the year. Alternatively, you may conduct regular polls among your colleagues (e.g. anonymous employee feedback surveys).

With this voting system, users can enter their preferences and the total votes and leading candidate can be calculated. It’s a straightforward C project that’s simple to grasp. Small-scale election efforts can benefit from this.
